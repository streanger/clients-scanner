26.05.2020, todo:
	fix widgets positions (padx, pady, etc)
	add frame for main rows
	add scrollbar for frame with rows
	make "night-mode-button" functional (+)
	consider replacing topbar label (images) and buttons, to buttons with images (+)
	add entries for timings in topbar (minimal time for visible, searching time)
	think of scapy slow import
	fix gui (with changes above), to work on linux
	log users activity, to file, in the following format, line by line:
        <current time>, <client mac>, <True/False>
	think of scanning for open ports
	make info about device (vendor, ip, mac) possible to copy
	define device type, by vendor, if not specified by user
	add bar with info about columns:
	DEVICE_TYPE, NAME, INFO, VISIBLE, DEAUTH, DEAUTH_CONTROLL
	think of early warning system, if device is seen
	consider splitting main class, into three independend (gui, search_clients, deauth)
	provide handle for searching gateway_ip and gateway_mac (independend of interface)
	store config files in package files directory

    -there may be problems with deauth poison/restore - for now status is not stored on gui side, only switching

    -problem to solve:
        https://gist.github.com/novel-yet-trivial/3eddfce704db3082e38c84664fc1fdf8
        This has been a huge help.
        How do I resize the inner frame to be the same width as the outer frame? I have tried assigning different widths in the VerticalScrolledFrame constructor and in self.inner, but the only way I have been able to get the inner frame width to match the outer has been to resize the outer one.
        EDIT:
        According to winfo_width() for the self.canvas, its window, and self.inner, I am able to resize them using a configure-type binding event on self.outer, but the widgets inside of self.inner do not resize along with everything else.
    -think of canvas_dynamically.py on_resize method

    -gui still need to be reshaped (for now uses pack over grid)
    -writing to .json could be handled using database (tinydb or similar) 
    -handling change of network and/or choosing network/interface
