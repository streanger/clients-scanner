Description: clients_scanner
        ===========
        Local network clients scanner, with possibility of deauthentication
        
        Info
        ===========
            - when creating app I was inspired by Android Fing application
            - application shows local network devices
            - stores known devices in client.ini file
            - allows us, to perform deauthentication(disconnecting devices connected over WiFi)
            - deauthentication bases on: https://github.com/roglew/wifikill
            - any future changes are described in "Todo" section
            
        Install
        ===========
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            pip install clients_scanner
        
        Usage
        ===========
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from clients_scanner import scanner
        
            scanner()
            # then just press enter, and wait for gui app to start running
            # due to slow import of scapy, it could take few seconds
        
        
        Example application view
        ===========
        .. image:: example_view.png
        
        Todo
        ===========
        26.05.2020, todo:
        
            - fix widgets positions (padx, pady, etc)
        
            - add frame for main rows
        
            - add scrollbar for frame with rows
        
            - make "night-mode-button" functional
        
            - consider replacing topbar label (images) and buttons, to buttons with images
        
            - add entries for timings in topbar (minimal time for visible, searching time)
        
            - think of scapy slow import
        
            - fix gui (with changes above), to work on linux
        
            - log users activity, to file, in the following format, line by line:
            
              <current time>, <client mac>, <True/False>
        
            - think of scanning for open ports
        
            - make info about device (vendor, ip, mac) possible to copy
        
            - define device type, by vendor, if not specified by user
        
            - add bar with info about columns:
            
              DEVICE_TYPE, NAME, INFO, VISIBLE, DEAUTH, DEAUTH_CONTROLL
        
            - think of early warning system, if device is seen
        
            - consider splitting main class, into three independend (gui, search_clients, deauth)
        
            - provide handle for searching gateway_ip and gateway_mac (independend of interface)
            
            - store config files in package files directory
